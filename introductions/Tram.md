Hello, I am Tram

What I did:
- Forking `fs9-git` repo from Integrify-Finland.
- Checking branches and cloning SSH url to my local.
In my local:
- `git clone url` ==> to clone repo to local
- `git remote -v` ==> to check origin path 
- `git branch` ==> to check the branch
- `git checkout develop` ==> to switch branch, make sure that we have `develop` branch already

Creting a file with name `Tram.md` in the `introductions` folder.
- `git add .` ==> to add 
- `git commit -m message` ==> to commit
- `git push origin develop` ==> to push to `develop` branch to forked repo
- `git status` ==> to check changes
- `git log` ==> to list did commits
